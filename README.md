# AmazonEmployeeAccess

The competition can be found here: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/amazon-employee-access-challenge/overview. The purpose of the competition was to predict an employee's access needs, given his/her job role. I attempted various methods: naive Bayes, logistic and penalized regression, SVM, and random forest. Ultimately, random forest performed the best in this competition with a score of 0.88495.
